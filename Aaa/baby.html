        Whence come the thousands of photographs used every month by newspapers
        and magazines?
      </p>
      <p>
        More than that, whence do the photographs come which are used by makers
        of calendars, postcards, for advertisements, and for illustrating books,
        stories and articles? <br />

        This little book is a practical, up-to-the-minute answer to the
        question: <strong>"How can I make my camera-work profitable?"</strong>

        At first thought, the answer is, "From professional photographers and
        publisher-photo-services.<strong
          >" But professional photographers do not produce one-third of the
          photographs used, and publisher-photo-services are supplied by that
          same large number</strong
        >
        of camerists that supply publications with most of their prints
      </p>
      <p>
        No one can deny that the greatest number of prints published are bought
        from amateur photographers in towns no larger than the average, and
        sometimes smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >The camerist does not have to get in an air-ship and fly to Africa in
          order to produce photographs that will sell. Read what Waldon Fawcett
          says, himself a success at selling his photographs:
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "The photographer is apt to think that all his ambitions would be
        realised if only he could journey to foreign shores or to distant
        corners of our country; or if he could attend the spectacular events
        that focus the attention of the world now and then. [emphasize] This is
        a delusion. The real triumph is that of the photographer who utilises
        the material ready at hand in his own district, be it large or
        small."[end]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          And more, a person does not have to be an expert photographer in order
          to succeed at the work. Here is what one prominent writer says about
          it:</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        "The requirements of the field are well within the capabilities of even
        the beginner in photography, viz.; the ability to make good negatives
        and good prints, the ability to recognise news-value, and a methodical
        plan to find the market where the prints will find acceptance. The man
        or woman who can meet these requirements should be fairly successful
        from the beginning, and will open up quickly new avenues of special work
        and profit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          In short, ability to make metaphors, create lovely heroines or such is
          not at all necessary to the successful selling of photographs to
          publications.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Is the field overcrowded? [emphasis]No.[end] If there were ten times as
        many persons engaged in the work they could all keep themselves busy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >The field—how wide is it? Get out your map of the world. The field
          for [emphasis]making [end] photographs extends from the top margin to
          the bottom, and from the left to the right. The field for
          [emphasis]selling [end] photographs—which is more to the point—extends
          over about five thousand publications which use prints; not to speak
          of a few score of other markets.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>The markets may be classified briefly:</p>
      <ol>
        <em
          ><li>Newspapers</li>
          <li>Magazines</li>
          <li>Postcard-makers</li>
          <li>Calendar-makers</li>
          <li>Art-study producers</li>
          <li>Illustrations for books</li>
          <li>Illustrations for articles</li>
          <li>Prints for advertising.</li></em
        >
        <p>And there are more, of more specialised branches.</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >And how does it pay? Please note: "A certain magazine once paid
            <strong>$100</strong> for four prints of sundials. An amateur, who
            happened to be on the spot with a kodak, made over<strong
              >$200</strong
            >
            out of a head-on railroad-collision. A New York professional netted
            <strong>$125</strong> from the newspaper-use of a wedding-party, of
            considerable local prominence, which was leaving the church after
            the ceremony." One amateur "realised <strong>$300 </strong>a year
            for two or three years from a lucky snapshot of eight pet rabbits in
            a row."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          No discrimination is made between press-photographers. The person wins
          who "delivers the goods."
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I do not mean that the instances of <strong>$200</strong> or
          so for prints should be taken as the prices ordinarily paid. I do not
          maintain that there is a fortune awaiting the man with the camera; but
          I do say there are unlimited possibilities for salable photographs and
          almost an unlimited number of markets for them. But there are not
          "barrels of money" in it, for all. A person may add appreciably to his
          income for having sold photographs; and having developed the trade to
          a high degree, he may cash cheques to the amount of
          <strong>$5,000</strong> or more a year. But not every one. Just some.
          And it isn't like the log and the falling off it. It's work—hard
          work—[emphasis]hard work.[end]
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Success at selling press-photographs does not depend on the size of
            the town you live in, the cost or manufacture of your apparatus, or
            on your literary ability. It depends on you and your worship of the
            homaged gods of success if you would sell photographs. The gift of
            these gods is the ability to make good.</em
